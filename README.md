# LionPower
Electrochemical-thermal model

The model applies conservative numerical schemes to discretise non-linear, coupled PDEs and solves the discretised equations using both Jacobian based and Jacobian free Newton-Krylov methods. 

The model can be tested by running 'LionPower.m' in Matlab.

Numerical details of LionPower are available in [Yuan et al., Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 2021]. The accpeted manuscript of LionPower is provided in this repository as well.
