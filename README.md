Electrochemical-thermal model

The model applies conservative numerical schemes to discretise non-linear, coupled PDEs 
and solves the discretised equations using both Jacobian based and Jacobian free methods. 

At the current stage, the model works as expected but further optimisations are still required, 
and thus most functions are obscured. All functions will be available after optimisations.

The model is currently open for test by running 'Battery_model_Jacobian.m' in Matlab.
