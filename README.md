# LionPower
Electrochemical-thermal model

The model applies conservative numerical schemes to discretise non-linear, coupled PDEs 
and solves the discretised equations using both Jacobian based and Jacobian free methods. 

At the current stage, the model works as expected but further optimisations are still required 
for several functions which are currnetly obscured and will be made available shortly.

The model is currently open for test by running 'LionPower.m' in Matlab.
